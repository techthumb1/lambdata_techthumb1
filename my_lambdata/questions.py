Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
when others do the same for your code?

    It is difficult to pinpoint one specific importance of code reviews, it is such 
    a beneficial process, for the author and the reviewer; however, if I were to 
    choose one primary benefit I would have to say feedback. I believe good and 
    effective feedback is something that every developer appreciates, and implements 
    in their learning practices going forward. 
    For the reverse, it is very rewarding internally when I personally am able to 
    provide feedback on the functionality or complexity of an individual's project. 


We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
improve this situation?

    Containers are extremely useful and effective at allowing a company to build an 
    operating system that contains evrything needed to build an application. There 
    are 5 top benefits of using containers such as less overheard, increased portability,
    consistent operation, greater efficiency, and greater development.
